Depending on the shell you are using (e.g., bash, zsh), you will need to edit the appropriate configuration file.

For bash (default in many distributions):

bash
Copy code
nano ~/.bashrc
For zsh:

bash
Copy code
nano ~/.zshrc
Step 3: Add the Alias
Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line:

bash
Copy code
alias pgadmin4='/usr/pgadmin4/bin/pgadmin4'
